# ðŸ¦• Simple Deno, Oak, MongoDB CRUD wip

## 1. Get deno [Deno](https://deno.land/#installation)
### 2. Get [Velociraptor](https://github.com/umbopepato/velociraptor)
### 3. Run vr serve

#### Description
Package does not have any version locks in imports which means that things will break after time. This behaviour is intentional as this is a WIP learning experience. It is pretty fun to return to this project after a time and fix all of the broken things.
